`ClassTopics2` fits supervised topic models to count data (e.g. gene
expression) jointly with a binary or categorical response. It combines
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with a supervised latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA)-style reparameterization, estimated via full Bayesian
inference in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) (through
[`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/)), with an EM warm-start used to
initialize the sampler.

The model jointly learns:

- **Topics**: interpretable, non-negative variable signatures shared
  across observations (`beta`), and each observation's topic proportions
  (`theta`).
- **A classifier**: regression coefficients (`eta`) linking topic proportions
  to a binary or multiclass outcome, fit simultaneously with the topics so
  that the discovered topics are informed by the response they need to predict.

## Installation

`ClassTopics2` is not on CRAN. Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jfcarrilho/ClassTopics2")
```

### Stan / cmdstanr setup

`ClassTopics2` fits its models with [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/),
which is not on CRAN and must be installed separately:

```r
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

You only need to do this once per machine. The first time you call any
`ClassTopics2` fitting function, the package's bundled Stan models are
compiled automatically and the resulting executables are cached for reuse
on subsequent calls -- you do not need to compile anything by hand.

## Quick example

```r
library(ClassTopics2)

# counts:   a D x V matrix of non-negative counts (observations x variables)
# response: a length-D factor/character vector with 2+ categories
fit <- ClassTopics(
  counts   = counts,
  response = response,
  K        = 5,     # number of topics
  seed     = 123
)

results <- ClassTopics_results(fit, true_response = response)

# Diagnostic plots
plot_topic_correlations(results)
plot_topic_response_heatmap(results)
plot_top_vars(results, n_vars = 5)
```

## Cross-validation

```r
cv_fit <- cv_ClassTopics(
  counts   = counts,
  response = response,
  k_folds  = 5,
  K_topics = 5,
  seed     = 123
)

cvTestAccuracy(cv_fit)
overfittingGap(cv_fit)
```
